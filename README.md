## Highlights

- **Easy to use:** Use *Monaco* kernel, optimize for Markdown editing, and have the same editing experience as VSCode.
- **Powerful:** Support version control; Applets, runnable code blocks, tables, PlantUML, Drawio, macro replacements, etc., can be embedded in the document; support for [OpenAI](https://openai.com) auto completion.
- **High compatibility:** Data is saved as local Markdown files, and the extension functions are implemented in the original syntax of Markdown as far as possible.
- **Plug-in extension:** Support users to write their own plug-ins to expand the functionality of the editor.
- **Encryption supported:** Use encryption to save private files such as account number, and the password can be set separately for each file.

## Attention

- For more extendable, Yank Note sacrifices security protection (command execution, arbitrary file reading and writing). If you want to use it to open a foreign Markdown file, ⚠️**be sure to carefully identify whether the content of the file is trustworthy**⚠️.
- The encryption and decryption of encrypted files are both completed at the front end. Please **be sure to remember your password**. Once the password is lost, it can only be cracked violently.
